				<h2>PHOTOGRAPHY</h2> 
				<p> 
					Photography is a captivating art form that has been with us since the 1800s. 
					It’s a visual medium that captures moments, emotions, and stories through the lens of a camera. 
				</p>

				<p><b>Photography Defined:</b></p>
				<p>
					Photography can be broken down into its Greek origins: “photo” (meaning light) and “graphy” (meaning drawing). 
					Essentially, photography is the process of capturing light to create an image. 
					Whether you’re using a film camera or a digital one, the magic lies in how light interacts with the medium.

				<h2>THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLE</h2> 
				<p>
					The exposure triangle is a fundamental concept in photography. It involves three critical aspects that work together to determine 
					the exposure of an image
				</p>
				<b><p>Three critical components:</p></b> 
				<p>
					<b>1. Aperture:</b> This is the opening in the lens through which light passes. When you press the shutter button, the aperture adjusts
						to allow a specific amount of light in.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>2. ISO:</b> After passing through the aperture, light lands on either a digital sensor (in digital photography) or light-sensitive film
					 	stock (in film photography). ISO measures the sensor’s or film stock’s sensitivity to light.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. Shutter Speed:</b> The camera’s shutter opens for a specific duration, exposing the image to light. Shutter speed is measured in milliseconds
						 to minutes.

				<h2>PHOTOGRAPHY'S PURPOSE</h2> 
				<p> 
					<b>1. Creating Art:</b> Photographers express their creativity, emotions, and perspectives through their images.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<b>2. Documenting Events:</b> From weddings to historical moments, photography preserves memories and stories.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. Producing Commercial Work:</b> Advertising, fashion, and product photography fall into this category.

				<h2>FILM vs. DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY</h2> 
				<p> 
					<b>Film Photography:</b> It’s nostalgic, with a tactile process involving chemical development. Film enthusiasts
					appreciate its unique qualities, grain, and unpredictability.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<b>Digital Photography:</b> Instant feedback, post-processing, and convenience define digital photography. 
					It’s accessible to beginners and professionals alike.
